1. Download any of your preferred IDE. (VSCode (Preferrably), Atom, Sublime, Brackets).
IDE -> Integrated Development Environment.


2. Objects. -> It is also a collection of key-value pair. (Heterogenous).
-> In arrays, we CANNOT have custom keys. This is a downside.
-> This is resolved by Objects. They give the ability to customize.
-> We can give any key. (Mostly strings).
-> For objects, we will have Curly brackets.
-> When you have a variable as a key, then we use brackets [].
-> If we give key as some other data type (other than string), the JS engine will convert it into string under the hood.


Where to use what?
-> When we want to loop on something -> Arrays
-> When we want to access some custom key -> Objects
-> Arrays are sequential, that is, the ordering of the elements does not change.
-> Objects are non sequential, that is, the ordering does not matter.

-> Arrays have index, objects have keys.


Q. What is an array?
-> Collection of elements (Heterogenous).
-> Indexing is 0 to length - 1.
-> The keys have to be integers. (Non negative).
