1. Recap of Conditionals (if, else, else if, switch, ternary).
Condition ? <true situation> : <false sitaution>
2. Else if ladder - if, else if, else if, else if.
3. Nesting (One inside another).
4. Recap of Loops (for, while, do while).
-> Difference between while and do while (Do while will execute atleast once, while will check first and then execute).
-> While is an ENTRY CONTROLLED LOOP.
-> DO WHILE is an EXIT CONTROLLED LOOP.
5. Difference between == and ===.
-> == checks value. (Regular Comparison)
-> === checks value and data type. (Strict Equality)
-> = Assignment Operator.

!= (Not equal to) (Regular)
!== (Not equal with data type) (Strict Equality).
6. Recap of functions.
-> Define once, use (invoke / call) multiple times.
-> Code reusability.
-> Used to implement some sort of logic.
-> They take some input an give some output.

7. <!DOCTYPE html> -> Used to tell the browser, that the document is HTML5 document.

8. Data Type -> Object
-> The seuqence does not matter.
-> The data can be in ANY order.
-> Object takes KEYS as STRING ONLY. If we give anything else, it will CONVERT (.toString()) under the hood.
-> Object.keys(new_obj) and Object.values(new_obj)

9. Connect function to HTML Document.
-> onclick
-> ondblclick
-> onkeypressed

Assignment 1:
-> Create a page where I have 1 button.
-> When I click on that button. Open a prompt. (Ask for a number).
-> That means, do parseInt. (If it is NaN, then show some kind of alert or something).
-> If is a number.
---> Print (document.write) FizzBuzz Series upto that number.

1. If number is divisible by 3, print Fizz (Foo)
2. If number is divisible by 5, print Buzz (Bar)
3. If number is divisible by 3 and 5, both, print FizzBuzz (FooBar)
4. Else, print the number
