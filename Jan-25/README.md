Logic Building
-> Flow charts
-> Loops
-> Conditions.


Q. What is a flow chart?
-> Pictorial representation of steps we use to solve a particular problem.

Q. What is a Language?
-> Medium of communication. Collection of keywords which mean something.
-> Some rules of that language.
-> Set of rules/symbols.

Q. What is a Programming Language?
-> Medium of communication (We human <-> Machine).
-> We use it to provide commands to the machine.
-> Collection of keywords and some rules. (Syntax).

Q. What is Programming?
-> Giving instruction to solve a particular problem. (To complete a task).

Q. What is a program?
-> A set of instructions to solve a particular problem.
-> A collection of commands.
-> A collection of steps which needs to be executed.

Q. What is an instruction?
-> A single task / A single step for the machine to do.
-> A single statement.
-> Building block of a program.

Q. What is a pseudo code?
-> False code. (Fake)
-> It is not the correct code with respect to that programming language.
-> Pseudo code is used for Human <-> Human understanding.

Q. What are some prgramming languages?
-> Java, Python, C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Go, .NET, Kotlin, JavaScript, Perl, Swift, COBOL, C#, Pascal, Dart, R, Typescript,
HTML, XML, Embedded C, SQL, Assembly, 8086 Programming, ES, CSS, Basic, Prolog, Scala.

-> DBMS -> Databse Management Systems -> MongoDB, SQL, Firebase
-> ML -> Markup Language -> HTML, XML.
-> They are used to show some data/content. They don't execute any logic.
-> Styling Language -> CSS

-> JavaScript (Script) -> Scripting Languages -> Python, Ecma script, TypeScript, PHP, BASH...

! All Scripting languages are programming languages.

-> Scripting languages are used to run scripts of code. -> We just write a script and run it. There is no step of COMPILATION involved. They go through the script line by line and directly convert and execute on the machine.

What is Compilation?
-> Compilation is the process of converting the code into machine readable form. It takes the human code and convert it into machine understandable code.

Interpreted Language -> It is executed line by line.
Compiled Languages -> It is first compiled and then executed.

JS is an interpreted language.

JS, Python, Java, C, C++ -> High Level Languages. 
Assembly, 8086 -> Low Level Languages.

JS -> It is an interpreted Language.
-> It is a single threaded language.

Q. What is single threading / multi threading?
-> Executing a single step/instruction at any given time.

Q. What is JS -> JS is a single threaded scripting language. It is used in Browsers, Servers, IOT Devices, Smart Watches, Mobile Phones even used to Blockchain and Machine Learning.

The browser files should be in .HTML extension.
The JavaScript file should be in a .JS extension.

Developer Console.
1. Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools.
2. Right Click > Inspect
3. F12 / Shift+Ctrl+I / Shift+Ctrl+J

Click on the Console Tab.

1. How to output something.
-> console.log("Hey Geeks");

2. Variable -> It is a container to store the actual value;
3. Conditionals -> Control Flow, Branching. if condition.
4. Comments -> To help for understanding. The comments are not executed. They are skipped.
-> To put a comment, we do //.

5. To show output in next line. We use \n 




Assignment 1:
-> Write a program to check whether the number is greater than or equal to 10 or not.
Assignment 2:
-> Take 3 numbers and write a program to find maximum of those 3 numbers.
