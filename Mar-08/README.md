1. Functions in depth.
-> Anonymous functions.
--> Any function without it's name / without it's ID. It can be referred by a variable, which is okay but in itself, it does not have any name.

-> Functions can be saved in variables (var, let and const).
-> Functions can be saved in object (as a key value pair).
-> Function can be saved in an array.
-> Function can be passed as an argument.

2. Callback function
-> Any function which is passed as an argument to another function and then is later invoked from the main function is called as a callback function.

Writing logic is done in function definition.
Execution / function is function invocation.

6. eventListener
-> Listen for any event to happen and then call the callback function.
addEventListener(<event>, <callback>);

Assignment 1:
-> Continuing on the Gallery, add a functionality. On each of the image, when I click, show in a larger zoom popup.
--> On clicking of any image, show in a popup format.
--> That popup will have a close icon. (❌). Clicking on this will close the popup.
--> If you click outside the popup, then also the popup should close (This is mandatory to implement).
