CSS concepts.

1. Why do we need CSS?
-> To style (looks) the HTML document.
-> To give layout.
-> Cascading Style Sheet.
-> We are currently on CSS3 (1999) ❌
-> We are on CSS 4.15 (Dec 2020) ✔
-> CSS was started in 1996
-> CSS is a StyleSheet language
--> XSL -> Extensible Stylesheet Languge. (Style an XML document)
--> DSSSL -> Document Style Semantics and Specification Language
--> SASS -> Syntatically Awesome Stylesheet. (Gives superpowers to CSS, it needs to be converted to CSS so browsers can undersant).
--> JSSS -> Javascript StyleSheet


2. 3 ways of adding CSS
-> Inline CSS (Adding the CSS as a style attribute). (Don't do it, lest recommended).
-> Second, internal CSS (Adding style tag in the document). (Medium Approach)
-> Third External CSS (All the CSS will be in a separate file). (Best approach). Benefits -> Easy to read and easy to maintain.


3. CSS Selectors
-> A rule which describes which element (or elements) will have that specific style applied.
-> Basically, any element which matches the rule will have the Style applied.

-> Type Selector (p, h1-h6, input, form, div, span).
-> Attribute Selector [key="value"] -> Select the element based on the attribute.
-> ID Selector (#<id_value>) -> This is equivalent to [id="<id_value>"]. But more readable.
-> Class selector Uses (.) equivalent to [class="<class_value>"].

ID vs Classes
-> ID (Identifier) -> Much like our Aadhaar Card, it has to be unique. (One person cannot have 2 id and 1 id cannot be given to 2 elements).

-> Class (Classifier) -> Just classify a bunch of elements. (For example us, you have the class of Jan21Web Fundamentals, Some of us also have class of Dec21Webfundamentals. Some us later will also have the class of MarAdvFrontend). Many elements can have the same class name and one element can have multiple classes.


4. color / background-color / text-align / margin / border / float
