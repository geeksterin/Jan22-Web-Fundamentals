Q. Different Data types?
-> int, float, char, double, boolean, number, string, long, short, object, byte, var char, null, undefined, enum,

2. Data Types in JS
- Boolean (true | false)
- String (A combination of characters, Put it inside double or single quotes).
- Number (1, 2, 3, 2.8, -10, -55.78).
- Null (Nothing)
- Undefined (The data type is not set)
- BigInt (Big Integer, Reallllllly big numbers 2^50, 2^55)
- Symbol data type ([[]], double square brackets)
- Objects (A collection of properties and function).

Data type vs data structure.
-> Data Structure -> Array, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Linked List
-> Data Type -> Objects, Nul, undefined, etc. etc.

3. How to check the data type?
-> typeof (typeof operator).

4. Primitive Data Type and Non Primitive Data type.
-> The lowest data type of any programming language. It cannot be broken further.
-> Non Primitive Data Type -> This is a combination of other primitive and non primitive data types. (Objects)

5. JS is a dynamically typed (loosely typed) language.
-> It does not care about the Data type. We can create a variable with 1 data type and then later update it with another data type.
-> opposite -> Statically typed (Strictly typed) language. Java, C, C++, Objective C, Swift

6. Mathematical operations in JS.
+, -, *, / -> Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
% -> Modulo -> It gives the remainder.

7. Comparison -> == (Double equals).
-> (>) -> Greater than
-> (<) -> Less than
-> (>=) -> Greater than or equal to.
-> (<=) -> Less than or equal to.

8. alert -> This creates a popup and shows in the browser.
9. prompt -> This is used to take the input from the user.
-> In prompt, we can give some hint text.

10. Rules for a variable name.
-> Start a variable name with a alphabet or an underscore.

11. JS is a case sensitive scripting language -> If we created a variable with name ABCD (All caps), then in order to use it, we need to use ABCD (All caps) only.

12. Semantics -> For readability. Give meaningful variable names.

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
― Martin Fowler

13. JS is an interpreted language. It is executed line by line. Suppose if my script were to crash at any line, then any code written after that line will not be executed.

14. Inputs are always going to be string.

15. Number + Number -> Mathematical addition
Number + String -> String Concatenation (Combining).

16. Parse (Conversion) the string into an integer. parseInt

Assignment 1:
-> Take 3 numbers from the user and alert minimum of those three.
(10, -20, 50 -> -20), (15, 20, 45 -> 15).
Assignment 2:
-> Take a character from the user and show whether it is a volvel or consonant.
