1. Boilerplate -> Already prepared, ready to consume code.

2. Data Type -> Type of data. It gives information about the type of the data we have in the variable.
3. Interpreted languages are Executed line by line. Compiled languages are executed as a whole file.
4. How to check the data type -> typeof operator.

1. Unary Operator -> It takes only 1 operand (Example, typeof)
2. Binary Operator -> It takes 2 operands (Example, +, -, %, *, /, ^).
3. Ternary Operator -> It takes 3 operands. (Example, ?:).

5. Nesting -> Having 1 thing (if, loop, for, while, switch, object, function, array) inside another is called nesting.

6. in the if else (The else is optional, we can have if without an else). Howver, opposite is not true. We cannot have else without if.

7. else if ladder -> It's a chain of if / else if / else if / else if / else (optional).

8. Indentation -> 
It is the space which we give before starting the line of code. It is helpful for alignment. It is helpful for code readability. (2 spaces, 4 spaces).

9. Array ->
- Collection of data (It can be homogenous or it can also be heterogenous).
-> To create an array, we just need to do [];
-> All array elements are identified by an index, which starts from 0.
-> An array is a collection of elements.
-> Elements are separated by comma.
-> Create, Read and Update, Insert
-> <array_name>.push(<new_element>);

9. Homogenous -> Same type.
10. Heterogenous -> Mixed data.



Assignment 1:
-> Take the inputs from the user. It has to be dynamic. I can enter 3 numbers as well as 30 numbers. It should give me the maximum of all of them. We will be using Array as the underlying (in the code) data structure.






4. Array (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
2. switch
3. Object
