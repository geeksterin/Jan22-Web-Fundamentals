1. Function definition - The piece of code which DEFINES what a function will do.
2. Function Invocation - When the function is called.
3. Parameter / Formal Parameter -> The variables which I use for any function input during the function definition.
4. Argument / Actual Parameter -> The actual values which I send when I invoke any function.


5. getElementsByName -> Used to refer to the element (mostly input) using their name attribute. There can be many elements with the same name attribute, so it returns an array of elements.

6. Giving Style using DOM.
-> Directly changing the DOM element's style.
-> Changing the classes. -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList
-> Changing the id.

7. Aligning any item in center;
8. Almost every Programming language is case sensitive.

9. document.body -> To access the body element. You can also do, document.querySelector("body");. document.getElementsByTagName("body"); document.getElementById();

10. innerText vs innerHTML

Assignment 1:
-> Create a page, have a toggle button. On this button, if I click once, show the popup, inside the popup have the close button.
-> I should be able to do it again and again without refresh.

Assignment 2:
-> You have 2 variable. Both of them are number.
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
-> Your task is to swap these variable.
(Your logic here). YOU CANNOT USE ANY OTHER VARIABLE.
--> a; 20
--> b; 10

Even if you display in console, it's okay.
